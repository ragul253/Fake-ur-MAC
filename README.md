# MAC Address Spoofing Tool

This Python script allows you to spoof the MAC address of a target device on a local network using the `scapy` library. MAC address spoofing can be used for legitimate purposes such as network testing and troubleshooting. However, it should be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Features:
- Spoof the MAC address of a target device on the local network.
- Restore the original MAC address of the target device.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library (install using `pip install scapy`)

## Usage:
1. Open the `mac_spoofing.py` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the `target_ip` and `spoofed_mac` variables to specify the target IP address and the MAC address you want to spoof.
3. Save the file and run the script using Python.

## Example:
```bash
python mac_spoofing.py
```

## Steps to Use:
1. Run the script and specify the target IP address (`target_ip`) and the MAC address you want to spoof (`spoofed_mac`).
2. The script will first retrieve the original MAC address of the target device.
3. It will then send an ARP request with the spoofed MAC address to the target device, spoofing its MAC address.
4. Wait for some time to simulate the spoofed state (e.g., 5 seconds).
5. Finally, the script will send an ARP reply with the original MAC address to restore the target device's MAC address.
